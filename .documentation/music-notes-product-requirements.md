# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Elevator Pitch

This is a social music platform where your taste is the currency. Users earn "Notes" — a social token — when tracks they upload or share get upvoted by others. These Notes can be spent to upvote other songs, unlock private playlists, or access exclusive early releases. It's a vibrant, people-powered ecosystem for discovering new music, rewarding curators, and helping emerging artists break through — all driven by human taste instead of algorithms.

## 2. Who is this app for

- **Music Lovers**: Listeners who love discovering new music and want a more human-curated experience.
- **Curators & Influencers**: People who want to build a following and earn social currency by sharing great tracks.
- **Emerging Artists**: Independent musicians looking for exposure, community engagement, and an alternative to algorithmic platforms.
- **Digital Natives**: Users familiar with Reddit, Spotify, and social token mechanics who want a gamified, taste-driven experience.

- **Personalized Feed**: Music feed customized based on user preferences, followed curators, and trending tracks.
